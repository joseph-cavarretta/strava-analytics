## Overview
This project exports all of a users activities from the Strava REST API, transforms the data to generate custom metrics, and models the data into an interactive web dashboard using the Dash library for Flask within a Docker container.

**Note:** This project does not currently accept API tokens for other users. A future version will allow users to inject their own API crednetials to dashboard their own data.
